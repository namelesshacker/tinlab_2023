Voor de controle op nitraat en ammonium in water zijn verschillende sensoren, sondes en meters  te koop.
\paragraph{4-variabelen-model}

Een sensor om bijvoorbeeld de concentratie  nitraat in water te bepalen kan met een Nitraat ionselectieve elektrode ( ISE) stekker. Nitrate Ion-Selective Electrod
Deze bestaat ui een zilveren chloride geleider is PVC omhulsel. De inwendige geleider is gescheiden van het medium door een polymer membraan. Deze heeft interactie met de nitraatinonen.

Doel: autonomy (level 5): The vehicle can do all the driving in all circumstances, [and] the human occupants are just passengers and need never be involved in driving.

Autopilot can center a Tesla in a lane, even around curves, and adjust the car’s speed based on the vehicle ahead.
Another feature can slow a Tesla to a stop at traffic lights and stop signs. 
Autopilot can’t perform some of these tasks if a road’s lane markers are faded or missing, and it can’t make turns.
