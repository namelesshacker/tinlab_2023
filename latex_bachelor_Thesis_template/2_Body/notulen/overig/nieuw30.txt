1.	Algemene omschrijving
Deze module behandelt een aantal varianten van zakelijk schrijven. Allereerst zullen de sollicitatiebrief en het CV worden behandeld. Daarna komen diverse zakelijke rapportages aan bod. Zoals bijvoorbeeld een essay en diverse soorten zakelijke rapporten, zoals in- en externe rapportage, proposal en executive of management summary. 

In de lessen zal voornamelijk instructie worden gegeven over het opstellen en structureren van de genoemde producten.Tevens zal er aandacht worden besteedt aan een aantal oefeningen, de vereiste woordenschat, en de te gebruiken vaste uitdrukkingen en signaalwoorden. Samenwerken met andere studenten is tijdens het oefenen mogelijk en aan te bevelen. 
        1.1 Inleiding
Het valt te verwachten dat je in je latere beroepsomgeving veel te maken gaat krijgen met Engelse informatie op je vakgebied. De vaktaal op IT gebied is namelijk vaak Engels. Dat geldt natuurlijk ook voor een internationale zakelijke omgeving waar de voertaal waarschijnlijk Engels zal zijn. En ook bij correspondentie met het buitenland (maar ook in instructies, gebruiksaanwijzingen, rapporten, e.d) zal de belangrijkste taal waarschijnlijk Engels zijn.

Deze module heeft tot doel je te trainen in het schrijven van zakelijk Engels op het vakgebied. Het vergroten van de idioomkennis, het gebruik van structuren en regels en grammaticale tips & tricks zijn enkele middelen om dit te bereiken.
        1.2 Relatie met andere onderwijseenheden
De module Engels Zakelijk Schrijven heeft een relatie met de instaptoets Engels of de bijspijkermodule waarin de basisprincipes van de Engelse grammatica zijn behandeld. Daarnaast is er natuurlijk ook een relatie met de overige Engelse modulen, Teksten, International Business Skills en Presenteren en het afstuderen waar bij de scriptie een Engelstalige management summary geleverd moet worden.

    3. Toetsing en beoordeling
3.1 procedure
De beoordeling bestaat uit de volgende onderdelen:
- het schrijven van een Engelstalige sollicitatiebrief plus CV n.a.v. een echte (bijgesloten) advertentie;
- het schrijven van een zakelijk rapport naar keuze (short report of essay of proposal of executive summary) over een vakinhoudelijk probleem/fenomeen;

Voor de sollicitatiebrief, het CV en het rapport geldt dat elke fout (taal, structuur, samentrekking) 1 strafpunt oplevert. Als in de solliciatiebrief een stuk toelichting ontbreekt (over schrijver of vacante positie) levert dat 2 strafpunten op. Als in het rapport een gedeelte uit het format ontbreekt levert dat 4 strafpunten op.

Het totaal aantal strafpunten wordt gedeeld door het totaal aantal pagina’s met tekst min 1. Dat aantal wordt gedeeld door 3 en dat cijfer wordt afgetrokken van 10 om tot het eindcijfer te komen (3 fouten = -1 punt). 

Eén en ander dient uiterlijk op vrijdag in lesweek 9, voor 13 uur ingeleverd te worden, voorzien van een voorblad met daarop je naam, studentnummer, klas en vakcode. Onvolledige en onjuist uitgevoerde opdrachten worden niet beoordeeld. Inleveren gebeurt door je werk te uploaden in het anti-plagiaatprogramma Ephorus (https://www1.ephorus.com/students/handin_nl) (inlevercode: raajb@hr.nl ) Ingeleverd werk wordt alleen beoordeeld als het scanrapport van Ephorus ontvangen is.

Onvoldoendes kunnen worden herkanst door verbeteringen aan te brengen en uiterlijk vrijdag voor 13 uur in lesweek 10, van de volgende periode opnieuw in te leveren. Voor digitale feedback kijk je op med.hro.nl/raajb in de map van je opleiding. Voor aanvullende uitleg kun je een afspraak maken met je docent via email (raajb@hro.nl)

Aanwezigheid bij de lessen is niet verplicht maar wel zeer aan te raden. Wees op tijd, als je te laat komt kan je de toegang tot de les worden ontzegt. Als je de huiswerkonderdelen voor klassikale bespreking niet bij je hebt en dus niet kunt participeren ben je niet welkom in de les.

Enclosed: Curriculum Vitae



Contemporary CVs contain limited personal information, a clear objective aimed at the vacancy you are applying for, and a flexible order when it comes to experience and education: The one that sells you best in relation to this vacancy comes at the top. However, the latest experience and education is always mentioned first. Tasks carried out in the past always get past tense. It is smart to additionally refer to specific (language and/or computer) skills under an individual heading. See example below. 

There is no such thing as a fixed format in international CVs, therefore, allow yourself be inspired: find examples of CVs from your future work field that appeal to you.

It has been estimated that 70% of business writing never leaves the office. It simply relays requests and information between people and departments within a company. These forms of business writing used to be memos, short reports, etc. In today’s age most internal business writing takes place through email.

A memo (short for memorandum) is written for internal purposes and meets the need for fast internal communication within a firm. The main difference between a memo and a short report is  that the short report is more elaborate than a memo. Moreover the short report is always written as a result of a request from management. A short report will include a series of main ideas, supported by examples, advantages/disadvantages etc. In other words: a short report offers space for discussion. As is the case with all business correspondence you are not supposed to use contractions in your memos and reports.

Short Report lay out:

TO: xxxxx xxxxx (1)
FROM : xxxxx xxxxx (2)
DATE : xx xxxxxxx xxxx (3)
SUBJECT: XXXXXXXXXXX(4) 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (5)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (6)

(1) & (2)  Either email addresses, job titles (Marketing Manager) or names (Andrew Brown to Mrs G. Finites).

(3) 	The easiest way to write the date is day, month, year, so "28 September 2010". Do not use numerals to avoid confusion with American English usage.

(4) 	No verbs are used in the subject line:
Mimosa Contract or
Re-scheduling of Delivery Date

(5)	The text should be short and clear, with simple sentences and 
 	paragraphs. Paragraphs can be numbered and items listed.

(6)	No complimentary close, no signature.
The Subject Heading
A subject heading is always part of letters, a memos and short reports. It should be both accurate and brief and focus on the bottom line of the message. Nouns are used in subject headings not verbs.
Example
Your goal:	to recommend that we buy a new computer
Subject:	(Recommendation) Purchase of new computer
Exercise
Please provide subject headings for the next two reports.
Your goal:	to inform personnel on ways to prevent accidents
Subject:          .......
Your goal:	to ask employees to evaluate the new e-mail program
Subject:          .......
Exercise
Identify a related noun for the following verbs:
a. replace			e. destroy			i. clean			
b. modify			f. dismiss			j. support		
c. inspect			g. approve			k. transfer		
d. prevent			h. store				
Seeing that lots of internal messages are sent in business the topic and goal of the report must be clear, not only to the writer, but especially to the reader. 
Exercises Subject Heading
Study the following two memos and improve their subject headings:
1.        TO: Drilling Manager	
FROM: Drilling Supervisor
DATE: 7 June 2011	
SUBJECT:  A Departmental Problem
As a result of bad weather, the Department is facing serious delays in the delivery of an important shipment.
You are therefore requested to authorise an immediate meeting with Shipping Division and Logistic Department, at which this problem might be discussed.

2.        TO: Departmental Heads	
FROM: Warehouse Manager
DATE: 3 October 2011	
SUBJECT:  Rain Damage to Warehouse

All Departmental Heads are notified that parts of the warehouse building are now unsafe, due to subsidence after the heavy rains of last week.

The warehouse will therefore be closed for essential repair work on Monday and Tuesday, 13-14 October 2011.
Structure Short Report

A short report has 4 distinctive sections:

Introduction: The opening paragraph(s)

Function
To establish why the short report has been written.

Contents
The introduction should contain:
    a) a reference to a previous communication and/or
    b) a description of the background situation and/or
    c) an explicit statement of the aim of the memo or report


Findings: The elaborating paragraph(s)

Function

To make the message of the short report totally clear and convincing.

Contents

It should contain a series of main ideas, supported by examples, facts, (dis)advantages, etc. The organization of this section depends upon the goal of the short report.

Conclusion: The concluding paragraph(s)

Function

To present the logical outcome of the information given above and to come to a general     conclusion

Contents

The conclusion should contain the writer's opinion and interpretation of the facts

Recommendation: The closing paragraph(s)
Function

To present the writer’s recommendation, following logically from all that went before   especially the findings.

Contents

A clear statement of the action taken or to be taken, the deadline for this action, the actor, i.e. the person responsible for taking this action.

Six Points to be Remembered When Writing Short Reports

1. specifying the goal 
At the end of the introductory section the full background of the memo/report and the reason why it has been written should be totally clear.

2. selecting and structuring
Essential information must be relevantly organized in a logical sequence. For example, if a piece of equipment is technically unsuitable, then the cost is irrelevant.

3. focus
The reader's attention should be focused on important points.

4. conclusion
The conclusion should show a direct link with the introduction and should contain nothing new or surprising for the reader.

5. formulating a subject heading
The report should have a brief and accurate subject heading.	

6. deciding upon techniques of presentation
A good memo/report is visually attractive for the reader with appropriate subdivisions and headings.


 Short report assignment 1
During a management meeting of a large multinational company, a proposal was made that all future training courses should be held in-company and that employees should no longer be sent on external courses. Following this meeting the Training Section was to review the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and to present its recommendations. The deadline given was 20 January 2011, and the report was to be addressed to the Personnel Manager. When the Head of the Training Section sat down to write his report, he began by making the following rough notes. (See notes below). Using all the information, write the Head of Training’s short report.
























Business E-mail Etiquette

•Try to keep the email brief (one screen length)
•Respond to emails within the same time span you would a phone call
•Check for spelling, punctuation and grammar errors before clicking Send
•Use a professional font, not decorative

Tone:
•No face to face contact, body language, tone of voice
•Leads to misinterpretations – especially if “conversations” go on too long.

–Words that begin with “un, non, or ex” or end with “less”
•Use smiles , winks ;-) and other graphical symbols only when appropriate

A good English essay expresses one main idea and gives the reader sufficient logical support which is also convincing. Usually an essay has four or more paragraphs, which correspond in function to the parts of the paragraphs:

The following illustration outlines the simple essay:

The parts of an essay

    1. Introduction and thesis statement:  this statement expresses the main idea of the essay in a sentence.  The thesis sentence is usually found in the introduction and is often the last sentence in the first paragraph.

    2. Body paragraphs: (1, 2, 3, etc.)  Each body paragraph has its own main idea and therefore its own topic sentence.  Secondary ideas support the topic sentences.

    3. Conclusion:  The conclusion should be the last paragraph.  You must have a conclusion to end your essay.
The parts of a paragraph

Topic sentence.  The topic sentence expresses the main idea in a sentence.
Points of support.   These are the secondary ideas to support the topic sentence.
Conclusion.   This is the final sentence, usually found in longer paragraphs.

In order to be able to write an essay, you should be quite sure that you can write good, coherent paragraphs.

A paragraph  is a unit of information unified by a central, controlling idea or theme.
This central idea is often expressed at some point in the paragraph by one sentence – the main sentence.  This sentence is most frequently found at the beginning of the paragraph, but can also be located at the end. The rest of the paragraph usually expands the theme contained in the main sentence, and each idea around the controlling theme or idea is supported by information and evidence in the form of illustrations, examples and arguments.

Writing good, clear, well-organised paragraphs also depends on the ability to (1)  order ideas and facts, (2) summarise, (3) state reasons, conclusions and connections, (4) qualify statements of fact or ideas.
Essay Writing; Practical tips

1.	TITLE & CONTENTS

Make sure you have a short but catchy title. On the title page you also mention your name and date. After the title page you start your essay with the introduction to your topic and then you just continue writing. Note that you do not give a table of contents or number your paragraphs.

2.	LAYOUT & PARAGRAPHS	

As you may know, each paragraph must deal with only one main idea or topic. The topic is introduced in the topic sentence, usually the first sentence of the paragraph. It introduces the main idea and tells the reader what the paragraph is about. Your paragraphs should be linked by using well-chosen (topic) sentences and not by using headings. 

3.	QUOTES

To support or explain your argument you can quote from the books and magazines you have used. Do not forget that you must always indicate where quotes come from. The first time you quote from a certain source, you should refer to your source in a footnote at the very bottom of the page (see 1). After that it is sufficient to refer to the author and page, as in the example below. A quote should be introduced and (usually) also concluded. Quotes of two lines or less may be imbedded in the text, "between quotation marks like this". Quotes of more than two lines should be set apart from the text by two empty lines, and indented both left and right. Such quotations will usually be introduced by a colon. In this case no quotation marks are used:

This is an example of an indented quotation. 
Indented because it is a quotation of more than
two lines. It is separated from the text by two
empty lines. No quotation marks are used, unless 
someone is speaking, of course.  
	1	(Booker, p.60)

4.	SOURCES

If you use sources, they should be mentioned on the last page of your essay. Here you list all the books, magazines, newspapers and Internet sites that you have used. This is how you refer to a book:

Hofstede, Geert, Cultures and Organisations; software of the mind, McGraw Hill Book Company, London, 1991
Horst, Han van der, The Low Sky: understanding the Dutch. Nuffic and Scriptum Books, Schiedam, 1996

When you refer to an article you do it like this:
from: 'Wish you weren't here', by Frank Barrett, The Independent, 15 August 2005

A reference to an Internet site should contain the following information: author (if known), title of document (if known), full website address and date of access.



Introductions and conclusions

These two elements of an essay often cause writers most difficulty. Strange as it may appear, the introduction should probably be the last part of the essay that is actually written, even though it appears at the beginning of the essay. The function of the introduction is to inform the reader as to what the essay will be about, encourage him or her to actually read the essay and explain how it will deal with its subject. It should normally end with the thesis statement.

Seven different ways in which the introduction to an essay may be developed are:

The inverted pyramid or funnel approach
The first sentence provides a general reference to the thesis statement and then each of the following sentences narrows this down to arrive at the thesis statement at the end of the introduction.

The short anecdote approach
Here the reader's interest is stimulated by beginning with a short account of something
that actually happened.

The survey approach
An overview of the main points that will be discussed in the essay is provided in this type
of introduction.

Using quotations
A relevant quotation is used to help the reader grasp the core theme of the essay.

Asking questions
A question is used to stimulate the interest of the readers so that they will read the essay
to find the answer.

Setting the scene
Essays which concentrate on describing personal experiences can often be begun with a
general sketch of the situation.

Defining a word or phrase
Essays may also be begun by defining a key word or phrase in the essay, especially one
that might be unclear to the readers or which is open to more than one interpretation.

There are four ways in which the conclusion to an essay may be developed:

Restating the thesis
The thesis statement can be restated in slightly different words and then expanded on and set in a wider context. When combined with the inverted pyramid style introduction, this gives the essay a rather pleasing symmetry.

Summarising the main points
Here the most important points in the essay are restated.

Key words or phrases
Key words or phrases (especially those used in the introduction) can be repeated and
emphasized.
Using a quotation
A short quotation, if one can be found, which sums up the key points of the essay is also
an effective way to end.

A key point about the conclusion is that it should bring the essay to a close. This means that no new ideas should be discussed in the conclusion. The purpose of the conclusion is to draw the reader's attention to the key point of the essay, so it should evaluate the points made in the main body rather than just re-state them. It should show how the thesis statement made in the introduction has been justified and it should point out any important limitations of the content and approach used, and also indicate where further research or thought is necessary.


Essay Writing Practice 1

You will be given main sentences and you must write a paragraph around them.
Write 2 of the following suggested paragraphs:

A.	Write a 100-word paragraph beginning with the main sentence:
	‘The Dutch attitude to dogs is difficult to understand……….”

B.	Write 100-word paragraph containing this main sentence:
	“ X is / is not the place I would want to live in/work at for a long time.”

C.	Write a 100-word paragraph beginning with the main sentence:
“It is difficult to say whether a meeting between two or more countries on the sports field does more for international harmony, or for international aggression.”

D.	Write a 100-word paragraph ending with this main sentence:
1.	‘This proves that women are not meant to be in powerful, responsible positions.’
2.	“This shows that it is about time women shared in the world’s decision-making processes.”

Writing Practice 2

Practice 2 is about the outlining and organization of essays.

Below you will find 10 essay topics. When you have chosen 3 essay topics from the 
10 listed, spend 10 to 15 minutes writing down ideas on each essay as they come to you.

Then organize your ideas into four or five paragraphs (or more if you think this is necessary) 
so that you can present your ideas clearly and effectively. See example ‘essay planning’ on 
the next page.

Do NOT write your essay as yet!!!


1.	“Most people play video games to escape from something”.

2.	Write an essay on your favourite type of music (Rock, hip hop, dance, classical) .

3.	“The average person is not very normal”.  Discuss
		
4.	Which do you feel is the most reliable of the media?

5.	Write an essay on prisons

6.	‘ I find politics so boring.’  Discuss the reasons for this frequently-heard remark.

Following is an example of essay planning:

Essay theme:	ETHICS

Essay title:	Discuss the idea of honesty in your community.

Rough notes on ideas:  -  general belief in property – different sorts of theft (property, land, money, ideas) – punishments for theft not consistent – theft from employers and institutions regarded as normal – children as thieves – compulsive stealing (for love?) – taxes as state theft 

Paragraphs:	

1.	Theft generally unacceptable, but some exceptions and paradoxes

2.	Stealing from individuals and consequent punishments

3.	Stealing from institutions, especially employers – different from paragraph 2.

4.	Theft and social class – the class bias in the Netherlands as seen in ‘social benefit   scrounging’ via tax evasion.

5.	Children – shoplifting - foreigners

6.	Conclusion – ‘property is theft’ - no absolute moral standards adhered to.  Most people inconsistent because ‘possession’ difficult to justify.

Essay Assessment Guidelines:

These are the criteria for a well-written paragraph. Use this checklist to critically examine your writing and determine how it can be improved.

Contents and ideas:

The writer has thought about the topic and has a clear thesis.
The writer discusses each main point enough to give the reader a reason to believe it.  The writer supports each main point, and no important point is left out.
The writer’s tone is clear because he or she writes in a sincere way, with the audience in mind.

Organization and form:

The paper has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with separate introductory, body, and concluding paragraphs. It moves logically in a straight line.
The reader wants to continue reading and can understand the thesis and other main points fully after one reading. It is clear which are the main points and which are the secondary points.

Writing conventions:

The writer uses a variety of sentence types to add interest to the writing.
The writer chooses vocabulary carefully to communicate clearly.
The writer uses English grammar effectively to convey the message.
There are few problems of verb tense, subject-verb agreement, word order,  
count/non-count use, or word form.
The writer follows rules for spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.






Written business proposals in essence are a form of business report, and, consequently, share many of the characteristics of a formal business report:
•	they are written in response to a request
•	they provide information
•	they aid decision making
•	they are objective, impersonal and authoritative
•	they are written in formal English
•	they are organised in sections using headings and sub-headings
•	they are normally based on investigation.
However, whereas a business report normally concentrates on the information first and then outlines its recommendations, a business proposal concentrates on the recommendations (what should be done) first and then uses the information to justify these. As with a business report, a business proposal should be coherent, so that the recommendations are seen as logical responses to the problems found out from the investigation.
The usual structure of a business proposal is as follows.
Title page - this should contain the name of the author, the date of submission, the title of the report and the name of the commissioner.
Summary - this should contain a very brief summary (maximum length is 5% of the total length of the report) of the main recommendations.
Introduction - this should clearly outline the nature of the problem you have been asked to solve (terms of reference), and how you obtained the information included in your proposal.
Options - this should outline the most important problems arising from your investigations, the main ways in which these problem could be solved, the advantages and disadvantages of these, and any potential risks involved in these solutions.
Conclusions - this should briefly summarise and evaluate the main options.
Final recommendation - this should specify the proposal(s) you recommend and any possible limitations and considerations which should be analysed before the proposals are implemented.
Bibliography - this should list all the sources used to write the proposal. 
Researched material and quotes should be referenced clearly.
Proposal assignment 1

You work for P.P&R., as Automation Consultant. 

You have been hired by Mrs E. Rogers of The Credit Company to advise them on the following issue:

The Credit Company has been fully automated over the last couple of years and still its Executive Director ( Mrs Rogers) feels that too much paper, and therefore money is wasted on paper and printing things like memos, reports, agendas and minutes for meetings. In her opinion, as a rule, all in-company mail should be sent to other employees by e-mail and as much external writing as possible should also be taken care of digitally.

All office employees have access to computers, so according to Mrs Rogers executing the above rules should not be a problem. A possible problem though could be that not all workers have their own computers. Part time personnel and outside sales representatives often have to share one computer (up to one computer for four colleagues). Beside this, some full time employees occupy their computers all day long and do not only use them for company purposes. They also use them to deal with private e-mails, etc.  

Keeping in mind Mrs Rogers’ demand to create a ‘near paperless office’, write a proposal suggesting recommendations. Of course you have to consider and elaborate on the current situation, possible problems, your own ideas (from expertise or research) and the advantages and disadvantages of Mrs Rogers’ demand and write a proposal suggesting recommendations.

Abstract vs Executive Summary, Definitions:
An abstract is an abbreviated summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject or discipline, and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose. 
When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given scientific paper. (Wikipedia)

An executive summary is, basically, anything but a product presentation, and nothing but a persuasive sales pitch. Far more than an abstract merely presenting the rest of the document, it's your unique opportunity to convince the reader that your proposal provides the best value proposition: the best benefit at the lowest cost. 
The more technical your proposal, the more critical the executive summary is likely to be, because, unlike the abstract, the executive summary forbids technicalities to instead concentrate on substantiating the benefits for the customer.
We may even say, paradoxically, that the executive summary, unlike the abstract, is not a summary, it's your value proposition, your best, unique opportunity to sell your solution!
Abstract vs Executive Summary, Differences
These are the differences between Abstract vs Executive Summary:

 
Abstract
Executive Summary
Nature
Abbreviated summary.
Unique selling point (USP).
Audience
Specialized (researchers), or mere readers.
Managers, as decision makers.
Scope
Informational, academic, administrative, and other general documents (thesis, articles, patents).
Solicited or unsolicited sales proposals and bids (P&B).

Job résumés fit in this case!
Purpose
Give information.
Ascertain the purpose of the whole document, give an overview or preview of its content.
Call for action.
Persuade reader to buy on the recommended solution addressing the problem.
Content
Mainly technical: 
- Present the problem and scope; 
- Expose the used methodology; 
- Report observations and results; 
- Draw conclusions and recommendations. 
Mainly managerial (4 rules of persuasion): 
- State outcomes and benefits; 
- Substantiate benefits with proofs of concept; 
- Apply benefits to the reader's particular; context (win themes); 
- Recommend a solution to address the problem. 
Length
Short.
Shorter than the executive summary.
Short.
Longer than the abstract.
Style
Technical, static, and more academic.
Managerial, dynamic, and more enthusiastic.

While the abstract aims at convincing the reader to go through the whole document in order to quench his thirst for information, the executive summary, at the opposite, aims at persuading the reader, who is supposed to be a decision maker, to take an action, whether usually buying a product, or approving another action. Furthermore, to be executive, the summary should be readable by non-technical people and, therefore, should not overwhelm the reader with too much technical information, if any, or too many details.
The Executive Summary 
Your executive summary should contain your value proposition, which should be seized right away by your reader. It is highly recommended that you read the suggestions below in order to write a proper and successful executive summary. 
To give credibility to your executive summary, the important items have to be presented in a simple, declarative, and persuasive manner.
The job of the executive summary is to sell, not to describe.
Write your executive summary for the lowest grade level possible. This way, you ensure that no barrier hampers your reader's full understanding of your point. 
Here are the key components that should be part of your executive summary:
1. The Grab: You should lead with the most compelling statement of why you have a really big idea. This sentence (or two) sets the tone for the rest of the executive summary. Usually, this is a concise statement of the unique solution you have developed to a big problem. It should be direct and specific, not abstract and conceptual. If you can drop some impressive names in the first paragraph you should—world-class advisors, companies you are already working with. Don’t expect an investor, a bank a potential client or commissioner to discover that you have two Nobel laureates on your advisory board six paragraphs later. He or she may never get that far.
2. The Problem: You need to make it clear that there is a big, important problem (current or emerging) that you are going to solve. In this context you are establishing your Value Proposition—there is enormous pain out there, and you are going to increase revenues, reduce costs, increase speed, expand reach, eliminate inefficiency, increase effectiveness, whatever. 
3. The Solution: What specifically are you offering to whom? Software, hardware, service, combination? Use commonly used terms to state concretely what you have, or what you do, that solves the problem you’ve identified. You might need to clarify where you fit in the value chain or distribution channels—who do you work with in the ecosystem of your sector, and why will they be eager to work with you. If you have customers and revenues, make it clear. If not, tell the investor when you will.
4. The Opportunity: Spend a few more sentences providing the basic market segmentation, size, growth and dynamics—how many people or companies, how many dollars, pounds or euros, how fast the growth, and what is driving the segment. You will be better off targeting a meaningful percentage of a well-defined, growing market than claiming a microscopic percentage of a huge, mature market. 
5. Your Competitive Advantage: No matter what you might think, you have competition. At a minimum, you compete with the current way of doing business. Most likely, there is a near competitor, or a direct competitor that is about to emerge .So, understand what your real competitive advantage is, and state it clearly. Here is where you can articulate your unique benefits and advantages. Believe it or not, in most cases, you should be able to make this point in one or two sentences.
6. The Model: How specifically are you going to generate revenues, and from whom? Why is your model leverageable and scaleable? Why will it be capital efficient? What are the critical metrics on which you will be evaluated—customers, licenses, units, revenues, margin? Whatever it is, what impressive levels will you reach within three to five years?
7. The Team: Why is your team uniquely qualified to win? Don’t just reproduce a shortened form of each founder’s resume; explain why the background of each team member fits. If you can, state the names of companies your team has worked for. Don’t drop a name if it’s an unknown name, and don’t drop a name if you aren’t happy to give the contact as a reference at a later date.
(8. The Promise ($$): When you are pitching to executives, your fundamental promise is that you are going to make (them) a boatload of money. Your Summary Financial Projections should clearly show that. But if they are not believable, then all of your work is for naught. You should show five years of revenues, expenses, losses/profits, cash and headcount.
9. The Ask: This is the amount of funding you are asking for now. This should generally be the minimum amount of equity you need to reach the next major milestone. You can always take more if investors are willing to make more available, but it is hard to take less. If you expect to be raising another round of financing later, make that clear, and state the expected amount.)
You should be able to do all this in six to eight paragraphs, possibly a few more if there is a particular point that needs emphasis. You should be able to make each point in just two or three simple, clear, specific sentences. This means your executive summary should be about two pages, maybe three. Please remember that the outline above should not be applied rigidly. There is no template that fits all companies, but make sure you touch each key issue. You need to think through what points are most important in your particular case, what points are irrelevant, what points need emphasis, and what points require no elaboration.
Some other general points:
- Drop names, if they are real; don’t drop names if they are smoke. If you have a real partnership with a brand name company, don’t hide it. 
- Avoid adjectives that sound impressive but carry no substance. “Next generation” and “dynamic” probably don’t mean anything to your reader. Everybody thinks their software is “intelligent”. Explain your company the way you would to a friend .
- Use simple sentences, not compound sentences. 
- Go back and reread each sentence when you're done: Are they clear, concise and compelling? 


Example Executive Summary

Adventure Travel International (ATI) will begin operations in September 2011 and provide adventure and sport/travel packages to people in the Pacific Northwest, specifically the greater Woodville area. An opportunity for ATl's success exists because the national tourism and travel industry is growing at 4%, and adventure travel at 10% annually. Further, the Woodville adventure travel market is growing at least 2% annually and there are no providers who specialize solely in adventure travel in the greater Woodville area. ATI is poised to take advantage of this growth and lack of competition with an experienced staff, excellent location, and effective management and marketing.

The company's goals over the next three years are:
•    Sales of $650,000 by year three.
•    Maintain margins of 10% on all airline travel.
•    Achieve 15% of sales from the Internet.
•    Develop strategic alliances with service providers nationally, internationally, and in the Woodville area.

In order to achieve these goals ATI needs to focus on the key areas:
•    Effective segmentation and targeting of adventure travellers within the larger travel market.
•    Successfully position ourselves as adventure travel specialists.
•    Communicate the differentiation and quality of our offering through personal interaction, media, and regional marketing.
•    Develop a repeat-business base of loyal customers in order to create sufficient sales.

ATI will be a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Shea Delaney in the town of Atkins Grove, California. The founder and employees of ATI are experienced travel industry professionals and are passionate about the activities ATI will promote and offer.

ATl's total start-up capital requirement is approximately $102,500. Start-up will be financed through the owner's personal investment and a long-term note of $85,000 secured from the Woodville First National Bank.
The travel agency market is competitive and technology, namely the Internet and Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS), has changed the way travel agencies operate. The Internet gives agencies and individuals the ability to perform travel related research. Discount airfare brokers have taken advantage of the Internet by offering tickets online at discounted rates. This has increased price competition. Computerized Reservation Systems have increased the speed and efficiency of the agency-to-customer transaction. They have also increased the start-up costs for travel agencies who wish to be competitive. One notable trend in the travel industry is increased deregulation. Deregulation has increased the need for differentiation and has, in many cases, lowered the prices of airfare and other travel-related services. 

The travel industry is highly fragmented. There are large national chains, small home-based businesses, consolidators on the Internet, etc. Membership numbers in some of the travel-related associations give some indication of the number of participants in this market. The American Society of Travel Agents ASTA) reports 25,000 members in 135 countries, most of whom are small businesses. ATI has approximately 30 immediate competitors in the greater Woodville area, including two agencies that are branches of national travel agency chains.

ATl's target customers are health-conscious couples and individuals, with median household incomes of approximately $50,000. They are interested in popular adventure activities such as skiing, water sports, and mountain biking. ATl's most important target customers, however, will be married couples, ages 25-35, with children and household incomes over $50,000.

The Woodville area, like much of the Pacific Northwest, has a large concentration of outdoor recreation enthusiasts. These health-conscious individuals, couples, and groups interested in popular adventure sports, such as skiing, kayaking, trekking, etc., are ATl's primary customers. ATl's target market is an exploitable niche, and ATI will provide a specialized and thus differentiated service. ATI has established relationships with providers of travel-related products and services. Two major airlines have been selected as our primary ticket providers in part because they do not cap the agent's profit on tickets. 

ATI has a number of major competitors that the company will seek to acquire market share from. They are: Rollins & Hayes, Sundance Travel and Global Adventure Travel. None of these competitors have the combination of price, scope, or local focus that ATI will be able to offer.

ATI’s pricing strategy will be a major consideration. Much of it will be determined by market standards.
ATI will attempt to maintain margins of 10% on all airline travel. Margins on all other products and services vary depending upon the provider but are expected to average 20%. ATI will make every effort to maintain a competitive pricing policy. However, as ATI builds its reputation as the premier provider of adventure travel, it expects to earn the ability to charge a premium for its services.

The company will also pursue an aggressive marketing campaign. During ATl's first year of operation it
will hold a grand opening and will organize and sponsor several athletic events. All ATI employees promote ATl's services to local athletic clubs. Negotiations with area health clubs have begun and additional promotions will likely occur through these strategic alliances. Specialty, rather than large national publications, will serve as media vehicles for ATI advertising. Local radio stations will also be used. Personal selling will occur, though phone solicitation will be limited. ATI plans to occasionally station sales personnel in locations around Woodville such as shopping mails. ATl's goal is to develop personal familiarity between its employees and the community.

ATI will be a small organization and its employees will share in management duties and decision making. Shea Delaney will act as the General Manager, but it will be important for each member of the team to be capable in all aspects of the business. Prerequisites for all ATI employees include at least five years travel industry experience, knowledge and ability in the types of activities ATI will promote, and Certified Travel Counsellor (CTC) certification for applicable positions. The CTC designation can be obtained through the Institute of Certified Travel Agents (ICTA). ATI will begin operations with four full-time positions. The positions are as follows; general manager and resident: Shea Delaney; marketing and advertising director: Jordan Barnes; accountant: Paul Mclellan; and one travel agent.

Prices will be competitive with the remainder of the market. The company's estimated sales for the first .year of operations are $534,607, increasing 10% annually for the next two years. The company does not expect any problems with expenses or cash flow within the next three years.Annual cash flow for the first year of operation becomes positive in the second quarter of operation.

Executive Summary
On January the first of 2007 the new law on social support has been introduced. This new law bundles old laws and gives municipalities a new task on healthcare. The new tasks on healthcare have to be carried out by social services department.
Centric Work, Income and Care serves municipalities with software, consultancy and education plans. Because of the introduction of the new law on social support there are changes on the market. With the changes there is a shift in budgets. It is important for Centric to follow these changes.
It is the opinion of Centric Work, Income and Care that the changes in social services department of municipalities ask for a reorganization of their consultancy packages.
During this internship the following question was answered: Which problems do municipalities have involving the law on social support and how can Centric help municipalities with these problems.
The project started with research on the law on social support. With this research some feeling for the subject has been created. After that a three days long course gave some insights about possibilities in the law on social support module in GWS4all. To have a good visual on the current consultancy Centric has to offer, interviews with employees of Centric Work, Income and Care have been held. Interviews have been held in different layers of the organization to create a valid view on the matter. With the Information gathered during the interviews with employees, interviews with municipalities have been prepared. During the interviews with municipalities questions about processes and sticking points have been asked. All this Information has served as basis for the analysis on the main question of the internship (stated bold on this page).
One results of the interviews with employees from Centric is that the consultancy offered on the law for social support is not proportional if one compares it to the amount of municipalities that use the social support module in GWS4all. Explanation: There are 184 municipalities that use the law on social support in GWS4all; during this internship nobody could tell one employee who was working on that same module.
Municipalities do give the signal that they are wrestling with their installation of the law on social support module in GWS4aII. Small and middle-sized municipalities ask for a periodic evaluation of their processes. A logical step would be to offer consultancy more actively and to have process consultancy in that consultancy package as well. The annually twice delivery of new versions of GWS4all would be a good moment for such a periodic evaluation. The success of the new consultancy package depends for a large part on actively offering the consultancy. A successfully finished project will serve as pr for municipalities that still have doubts.
Small municipalities have difficulties with hiring and keeping technical skilled application managers. When application managers leave the municipality, a lot of knowledge leaves with them. To help municipalities with this problem Centric should offer application managers to municipalities more actively.
But more important than anything else, the law for social support should be more important in the minds of employees of Centric Work, Income and Care. Off course employees will have more attention for LSS (law on social support) when more works has to be done, but to accelerate this process Centric should hire two employees just for the law on social support.
To help this process even more Centric should separate the documentation for the law on social support from other parts of GWS4all. Ever more because in interviews with municipalities they clearly stated that for the law on social support different organization forms are chosen.

Words:  Accurate, Brief, Clear
			Sentences: short and simple
			Punctuation and paragraphs: for sense and meaning

- PRESENTATION 	Appearance. Does it look good to the reader ? Get him on your side by making 				his job easy. 
			Lay out: headings, spacing, margins, numbering. The signposts to the reader.


3 After
- Typing		When? Before or after revision. The advantages of working from a typed draft.

- Revision		Re read the complete draft. Does it say what it should say? Is it complete, clear?
			Does it look good? Should new material be added? Discuss it with a colleague.

- Final check	Check typescript for errors. Are the facts and figures accurate. Are spelling and punctuation O.K ? Do not add new material anymore.





1.   In formal writing contractions (won’t) should be avoided. Instead the words should be
written in full (will not).

Example: Export figures won’t improve until the economy is stronger. 
     Export figures will not improve until the economy is stronger.

    2. The more suitable formal negative forms should also be used in formal writing.

Example: 	not......any > no
not....much > little
not....many > few

The analysis didn't yield any new results. > The analysis yielded no new results.

The government didn't allocate much funding for the program. > The government allocated little funding for the program.

This problem doesn't have many viable solutions. > This problem has few viable solutions.

    3. Limit the use of "run on" expressions such as "and so forth" and "etc."

Example: These semiconductors can be used in robots, CD players, etc. > These semiconductors can be used in robots, CD players, and other electronic devices.

    4. Avoid addressing the reader as "you".
Example: You can see the results of table 1. > The results can be seen in table 1.
This means using the ‘passive voice’ as much as possible

5.   Limit the use of direct questions.
Example: What can be done to lower costs? > We need to consider what can be done to lower costs. > We now need to consider how costs can be lowered.

Punctuation is a convention, the aim of which is to make written communication clear. 
1.   The full stop
•    to show the end of a sentence
•    to show an abbreviation (e.g. B.A.), but optional if the last letter of the abbreviation is the same as the last letter of the word in full (e.g. st)
2.  The comma
•    to separate items in a list ( The camp site was muddy, silent, dirty and dark.)
•    to separate the main parts of a sentence where a pause seems necessary ( He waited two hours, but she never showed up.)
•    before and after explanation phrases and additional phrases which could be left out but which help the meaning (Tomorrow, as you know, is ...)
•    before and after additional words (I will, however, return tomorrow.)
3.   The colon
•    to introduce a formal list ( The following people were at the meeting: Ray Boland, Marise van der Eijnden, Tony Blair...)
•    between two closely-related ideas, where the second provides an explanation of the first (Every student has his or her best subject: Jane 's is Sanskrit.)
4.   The semi-colon
•    between two balanced ideas (Pessimism of the intellect; optimism of the will.)
•    to join a set of phrases (He said that he was tired; that he was hungry; that he couldn’t do any more work...)
5.   The question mark
•    used to indicate a direct question (Are you going to the cinema tonight?)
•    but not with indirect questions ( She asked him whether he was going to the cinema tonight.)
6.   The exclamation mark
•    indicates a strong, forceful expression (Stop!)

7.   Brackets

•    used to show additional information inserted within a sentence where the sentence would have run smoothly without this information (The first step (see figure 1) is to...)
In American English these [brackets] are used.

8.   Dashes
•    these perform the same function as brackets, except that the information within them is
more closely related to the main idea - often used for emphasis (He was not wrong -far
from it- he was right.)
•    to show an afterthought (He was efficient - at least, he thought he was.)

9.   The hyphen

•    to form compound words (semi-detached)
•    to join two vowels that are the same when using prefixes (co-operate)

10. Capital letters
•	for real names, for names of countries, nationalities, languages, people, relations, places, days and months
•	for most abbreviations and acronyms
•	for the main words in the titles of books, films newspapers, etc.

11. The apostrophe
•    to show where a letter has been missed out (haven 't = have not). Remember it's = it is,
but not its as in "The cat ate its food, " and who's = who is, but not whose as in "Whose
book is this? "
•    with an s to show ownership (Peter 's hat), but remember that if the owning word already
ends in an s only the apostrophe is used (Mr. Peters 'hat = the hat of Mr. Peters)

12. Quotation marks
•    to indicate where the words directly used by someone else have been incorporated into a text written by another person (As Wordsworth wrote, "For oft when on my couch I lie, in vacant or in pensive mood... ")
