A[] Obs.taken imply (x>=2 and x<=3) to show that the transition is taken when x is in
the interval [2, 3].
• E<> Obs.idle and x>2 : it is possible to take the transition with x in the interval (2, 3].
• A[] Obs.idle imply x<=3 : to show that the upper bound is respected.
The former property E<> Obs.idle and x>3 no longer holds.

Recall the Train Crossing example of the
previous section. The following queries estimates the
probabilities that Train(0) and Train(5) will be in the
crossing before 100 time-units:

Pr[<=T](<> Train(5).Cross).
Pr[<=100](<> Train(0).Cross)
Pr[<=100](<> Train(5).Cross)

Example 3. In the Train Gate example, it might be sufficient to confirm that the probability that Train(5)
reaches the crossing within 100 time-units is larger than
that of Train(0). Posing the query:

Pr[<=100](<>Train(5).Cross) >=
Pr[<=100](<>Train(0).Cross)


Example 4. As an interesting property of the Train Crossing example, we want to know the average of the maximum number of trains that are stopped within the first
20 time-units:
E[<=20; 20000](max: sum(i:id_t) Train(i).Stop)
