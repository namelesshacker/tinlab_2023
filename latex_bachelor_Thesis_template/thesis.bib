	author   = "Shahri, Ehsan and Pedreiras, Paulo and Almeida, Luis",
	abstract = "MQTT is one of the most popular application-layer protocols used
	in the scope of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and
	Industrial-Internet-of-Things (IIoT), given its suitability for
	resource-constrained embedded systems. However, MQTT
	Quality-of-Service policies do not support timeliness
	requirements, which is common in IIoT. The literature reports
	several research works that address this limitation, but they are
	limited in scope (e.g., improvements in the broker's internal
	operation, control of the publisher's data rate, and path
	optimizations). Conversely, this paper presents a comprehensive
	architectural approach, proposing a set of extensions to the MQTT
	protocol that allow applications to explicitly specify real-time
	requirements and instantiate corresponding network reservations
	to enforce the desired temporal behavior. Such reservations are
	enforced via Software Defined Networking, specifically the
	OpenFlow protocol, but other protocols that allow bandwidth
	reservations, e.g., TSN, can also be used. This paper presents
	the proposed system architecture together with extensive
	emulation and implementation results that validate the
	feasibility of the approach, showing that time-sensitive MQTT
	traffic can be effectively segregated and prioritized to meet
	application-defined real-time requirements. Using several
	combinations of network topologies and load levels and comparing
	to the absence of the proposed real-time mechanisms, both average
	and worst-case latencies of the time-sensitive traffic decreased
	to approximately half, while for the normal traffic, they
	increased by approximately 10\%.",

	bioavailability of nutrients, the tolerance to abiotic and
	biotic stresses and management of seed-borneand soil-borne plant
	diseases. The second volume of the book Microbial Inoculants in
	Sustainable Agricultural Productivity - Functional Applications
	reflects the pioneering efforts of eminent researchers to
	explore the functions of promising microbes as microbial
	inoculants, establish inoculants for field applications and
	promote corresponding knowledge among farming communities. In
	this volume, readers will find dedicated chapters on the role of
	microbes as biofertilizers and biopesticides in the improvement
	of crop plants, managing soil fertility and plant health,
	enhancing the efficiency of soil nutrients and establishing
	systemic phytopathogen resistance in plants, as well as managing
	various kinds of plant stress by applying microbial inoculants.
	The impact of microbial inoculants on the remediation of heavy
	metals, soil carbon sequestration, function of rhizosphere
	microbial communities and remediation of heavy metal
	contaminated agricultural soils is also covered in great detail.
	In this Volume, a major focus is on the approaches, strategies,

	abstract     = "\#\# Introduction signageOS helps any developer to build apps
	for displays and remotely manage large networks of displays
	in a standardized way. No matter what display you are using,
	all APIs work across all of them. **Read more here:** *
	[signageOS](https://www.signageos.io) website * [signageOS
	Docs](https://docs.signageos.io) - documentation for
	developers and users \#\# About REST API The signageOS REST
	API brings extra features for signageOS users with
	out-of-the-box device management, monitoring, and maintenance
	service provided by signageOS. With an existing, scalable,
	and flexible solution you can easily integrate advanced
	features into your CMS via standardized REST API. No need to
	re-invent the wheel again. > All APIs are standardized and
	available across [all supported
	devices](https://docs.signageos.io/hc/en-us/sections/4405700629266-Supported-Devices).
	> To use REST API, you need an Organization on Device Plan
	1.0, 2.0 or 3.0. REST API does not work on free Open Device
	Plan. \#\# List of REST API Domains | Domain | Description |
	| --- | --- | | Device | Configure the device, set timers,
	brightness, volume, update the Core App, update firmware and
	much more, get device uptime, temperature, outages, content
	status or custom logs. | | Applet | Way to create your own
	Applets and its versions over API instead of Box. | | Timing
	| Timing REST API helps you schedule Applets (your HTML
	player) on the devices. | | Organizations | Organization/User
	REST API helps you to manage your account and create/delete
	organizations and retrieve security tokens. | | Account |
	Manage or delete security account tokens. | | Firmware |
	Manage firmware versions on supported devices. | | Emulator |
	Create emulators, test your environment or simply manage
	them. | | Policy | Manage policies with various settings, set
	up new policies or configure exiting policies and assign them
	to devices. | | Tag | Manage tags. | | Alert | (Coming soon)
	Manage device alerts and get informed about anomalies on
	production devices. | | Location | (Coming soon) Managing and
	filtering devices by assigned locations. | \#\# REST API
	Authentication For REST API your application needs to be
	authenticated using request `Header: X-Auth` which is
	different for every single organization (end company
	owning/using devices). There is a possibility to create a
	sub-organization for any of your customers in signageOS Box.
	1. Go to [Organizations
	section](https://box.signageos.io/organizations) in signageOS
	Box and generate your token\_id \& token\_secret. 2. Use it
	as `X-Auth` header separated by **semicolon** -
	`\_\_TOKEN\_ID:\_\_TOKEN\_SECRET\_\_`. ``` bash \# X-Auth =
	client\_id:client\_secret curl -XGET -H ``X-Auth:
	87e376c08d16XXXXb796294744:5ef829c933aXXXX710f5388a27fee''
	https://api.signageos.io/v1/device ```
	![](https://docs.signageos.io/hc/article\_attachments/4414348056210/generate-token.gif)
	> If `X-Auth` token is invalid or generated token does not
	have permissions in organization you will receive `403
	Forbidden` response. \#\# REST API Request Quota signageOS
	REST API automatically applies quotas on REST requests. The
	quota is counted per IP address of the Request origin. The
	quota is set to `200 requests per second` for instant
	response and `500 queued requests` with a slightly delayed
	response based on request type and performance. If you reach
	the quota API returns `429 Too Many Requests` response. > It
	is important to note that after creating a Company through
	REST API, the default Device plan is set to **3.0**. This can
	be changed from within SignageOS Box under your Company
	profile. \#\# Pagination There is enforced maximum length of
	data that can be returned in a single response. If there's
	more data available, than the limit allows, data will be
	returned in multiple pages. Cursor based pagination will be
	used.
	`https://jsonapi.org/profiles/ethanresnick/cursor-pagination/\#auto-id-query-parameters`
	Parameter `limit` can be used for setting the page size.
	Setting the limit over the max allowed limit will result in
	error. Beware not to change the limit in the middle of the
	process of fetching pages. If a different limit is specified,
	process needs to be started over from the first page. Request
	without additional parameters will return the first page. If
	there are more data available, the response will contain a
	header ``Link'' that will contain the link to the next page,
	e.g. `; rel=``next''`. Then by performing another request
	with the link next page will be returned. Each response will
	contain a link to the next page until there are no more data
	left. \#\# Url structure \#\#\# List parameters Lists must be
	encoded in the URL in the following way: ```` ... =\&=\&= ...
	```` For example, list with values `uid1`, `uid2`, `uid3`,
	encoded in URL as parameter `deviceUid`` will look like this:
	``` deviceUid=uid1\&deviceUid=uid2\&deviceUid=uid3 ``` \#\#
	Asynchronous REST API Requests While some of API endpoints
	can be ``fire and forget'', i.e. there is no need to report
	back to the client, for example, when initiating a bulk
	actions. For others, the **client may need a response, but
	can't get it in the original request** because of the long
	processing time, i.e. in case of firmware upgrade request or
	Applet operations. In those cases, we have to do a
	``pre-flight'' check and connect directly with device to
	execute the action, which can be a time-consuming process,
	often better performed asynchronously. For these asynchronous
	operations (typically all `/device/xxxx` endpoints) we
	adopted a **polling strategy**. Clients can retrieve the
	results of asynchronous requests by polling a special
	endpoint that will return the result of the request, once
	it's available. \#\#\# Standard Flow Example 1. The client
	sends the `PUT` request - set brightness to 100\% - to the
	server to begin the operation. 1. The server accepts the
	request, confirming by `200 OK` message. 1. The asynchronous
	process begins on the server side, triggering desired
	function - connecting to device, setting a brightness and
	confirming the value was set and accepted by the device. 1.
	Finally, the server finished the action by receiving a
	confirmation from the device - brightness successfully set to
	100\%. During this process, the client polls the `GET` URI of
	the brightness endpoint. The server returns the status of the
	last request: ```json \{ ``uid'': ``deed07d35fdxxx'',
	``deviceUid'': ``e824fcd24a4fxxx'', ``createdAt'':
	``2022-07-22T12:06:45.540Z'', ``succeededAt'':
	``2022-07-22T12:06:55.850Z'', ``failedAt'': null,
	``brightness1'': 90, ``brightness2'': 40, ``timeFrom1'':
	``09:00:00'', ``timeFrom2'': ``20:00:00'' \} ``` Status of
	the operation is available under `succeededAt` and `failedAt`
	keys. If the request succeeeded, `succeededAt` will be set.
	If it failed, `failedAt` will be set. If non of the two are
	set, it means that the request is still pending. ![Flow
	diagram of async
	requests](https://signageos-documentation.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/api/rest\_api\_flow.png)
	\#\#\# Important consideration In the polling pattern, the
	client must decide how frequently to poll the URL and when to
	give up. One common choice is exponential backoff, which
	increases the interval between checks until a maximum
	interval is reached or the response (succeededAt/failedAt) is
	received.",
